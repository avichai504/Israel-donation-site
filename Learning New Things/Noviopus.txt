Hello Avichai,

Attached is the contract for the work in Noviopus startup.
Please note that the work is currently without payment and without any commitment from both sides on schedule and time period.

Read the agreement, sign it, and send it back to me, or contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
Once this is done we can start getting you into the project.

Thank you,
Gilad Federman

Hey Gilad,

I'm good to start right away :) 
How about we catch up next Sunday?

In the meantime, I'd like to have some up-to-date documents about the company, or anything you think can be helpful.

Excited to start!
